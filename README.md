# Travis Scripts
These are some helpful travis scripts I have used in the past. 

The python file will need your authorization token as well as some other information inside it to work for your project.

I also included a sample .travis.yml file that should point you in the right driection. 
The travis_wait command will tell travis to wait for more than the default 10 mins that it will wait with no information recieved. 
If you need to wait longer or shorter simply tweak the number thats after the travis_wait and that will set the timeout.
